# Quake 1 Assets For Modern Formats

Assets from the game "Quake" by id Software converted to modern formats (e.g. obj, dae, png)

I was planning on using these assets for a project I'm working on, but I am making them public as other people might want to use them.


## Conversion Details

These assets were converted through a program called [Noesis](https://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91)

#### model format
.mdl ---> .obj

#### map format
.bsp ---> .obj

#### model texture format
.pcx (inside mdl file) ---> .png

sound files are unconverted (.wav)

#### model animation format
??? ---> .dae/.anm
(as of writing this, I have not been able to export animations as Noesis is only able to properly export 
skeletal animations instead of the vertex aniamtions that Quake mdls use)
